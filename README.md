1. to illustrate communication between two processes. One is shared memory(mmap), another is socket.
2. I design a virtual conversion which I will ask five questions here.
3. Three py files included:
   >1. xiangxiang.py stands for me 
   >2. strikingly.py stands for the great company. 
   >3. mymap.py is a encapsulation of mmap.
